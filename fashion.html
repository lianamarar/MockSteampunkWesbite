		<h2>Steampunk in Fashion</h2>
		<p>Just at first glance, Steampunk combines the past with the future, the old with the new. For many, steampunk became a centered theme of their costume from clothing to accessories to even hair and makeup. Many conventions were held in honor of Steampunk, as people from around the world have come together dressed in Steampunk themed attire to represent this magical theme. Steampunk started to make its way into mainstream high fashion, appearing in many runway shows from Christian Dior to Jean Paul Gaultier.

		Across men and women, you may find the wide use of leather, gritty watches, intricate walking sticks, many buckles and belts, and perhaps even tophats and goggles. For women, it is typical to see corsets or bustiers, while for men its long duster coats and fine metal details; much of which incorporates the brassy and earth tones.
