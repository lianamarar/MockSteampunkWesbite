		<h3>Analagous</h3>
		<p id="about">
		&nbsp;The analagous color harmony takes colors that allign well together along the color wheel. In this case, we took three prominent colors seen throughout the moodboard to create a palette consisting of 5 harmonious colors. While these colors are composite colors, the color theory here makes it so they are pleasing to see. This range of colors is easy on the eyes and provides the Steampunk feel. <br> 
		<br>
		The three chosen colors help to emphasize Steampunk by representing wood, leather, rusty machinery, and gears. I wanted to create an analgous color harmony because of the different variation of brown and beige tones that are defined across Steampunk themed material. In fashion, there is a great deal of brown and beige tones the flow in conjuction, yet there is also the juxtapositon on black and white textures that allow the colors to be highlight in a piece of clothing.
