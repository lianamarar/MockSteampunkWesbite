			<h2 id="summary">About Sancreek</h2>
			<p id="about">
				Sancreek has been designed for use mostly as a caps-only display webfont, though lowercase characters have also been included. Sancreek is a contemporary take on some of the large wooden poster fonts of the ninteenth century. Sancreek can be used freely across the internet by web browsers on desktop computers, laptops and mobile devices. This font was created by Vernon adams.

				<br>
				I chose 'Sancreek' to demonstrate Steampunk throughout this moodboard because I felt that the characters defined the Victorian Era well, yet incorporates a modern feel. The woodtype characters width is narrow and refined, having a sense as if they were stamped into some material. This vintage font can still be used in modern formats, thus in terms of the Steampunk theme, the spur-like font reminds me of divots in metal, or stamps in metal sheets.
